# Arduino UNO- Servo Motor (Set Up)

A Servo Motor is a special kind of motor that has the ability of rotating but only between 0-180 degrees, back and forth but it can’t spin in a full  360. Servo motors are used to control the position of objects, rotate objects, move robot legs, arms or hands, move sensors, etc. with great precision. Servo motors are small and since they have built-in circuitry to control their movement, they can be plugged directly into an Arduino.
